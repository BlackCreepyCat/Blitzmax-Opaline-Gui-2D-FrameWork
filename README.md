Description:
------------
Opaline UI is a low-level kernel for creating a graphical interface from scratch. I believe it can be easily converted to other languages, only if they allow linked lists. No complex external dependencies (it's self-contained). It need also includes some basic graphical functions like:

- Text/Box/Rect/Line/Oval/Circle/SetViewport/StringWidth (see the class: gui_core.bmx).

Example with the gui_core.bmx to C++ class convertion and SDL:

Maybe compatible or can be converted for:

- FreeBasic?
- Monkey?
- Monkey2?
- PureBasic?
- Java?
- Raylib?
- SDL/SDL2/C/C++?

The GUI is really ugly! :) But that's intentional... This way, only the GUI's behavior (the most important part) is coded; all the other graphical improvements take up code and make it less readable.

It's a kernel, very, very low level... But once the core of the GUI is converted, you're free to improve it! At least the widget behaviors (which are numerous, believe me! but invisible to GUI users) are there.
