You can use this code:
- However you wish, but you are prohibited from selling it...
- You can convert it into another language! Do not hesitate!
- Use it For paid/free apps/games, i don't care...
- I'm just asking for a small citation somewhere! :)

What you need to see? Just Blitzmax! (it's free/opensource) :

Description:
------------
Opaline UI is a low-level kernel for creating a graphical interface from scratch. I believe it can be easily converted to other languages, only if they allow linked lists. No complex external dependencies (it's self-contained). It need also includes some basic graphical functions like:

- Text/Box/Rect/Line/Oval/Circle/SetViewport/StringWidth (see the class: gui_core.bmx).

Maybe compatible or can be converted for:
-----------------------------------------
- FreeBasic?
- Monkey?
- Monkey2?
- PureBasic?
- Java?
- Raylib?
- SDL/SDL2?

The GUI is really ugly! :) But that's intentional... This way, only the GUI's behavior (the most important part) is coded; all the other graphical improvements take up code and make it less readable.

It's a kernel, very, very low level... But once the core of the GUI is converted, you're free to improve it! At least the widget behaviors (which are numerous, believe me! but invisible to GUI users) are there.
