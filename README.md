You can use this code:
- However you wish, but you are prohibited from selling it...
- You can convert it into another language! Do not hesitate!
- Use it For paid/free apps/games, i don't care...
- I'm just asking for a small citation somewhere! :)

Description:
------------
Opaline UI is a low-level kernel for creating a graphical interface from scratch. 

I believe it can be easily converted to other languages, provided they allow for 
linked lists. It also includes some basic graphical functions like 

Box/Rect/Line/Oval/Circle (see the class: gui_core.bmx).
