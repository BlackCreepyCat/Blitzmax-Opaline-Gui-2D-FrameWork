Description:
------------
Opaline UI is a low-level kernel for creating a graphical interface from scratch (or just a 2D framework able to draw something like box/rect/line/oval/text etc)

I believe it can be easily converted to other languages, only if they allow 
linked lists. It need also includes some basic graphical functions like:
- Text/Box/Rect/Line/Oval/Circle/SetViewport/StringWidth (see the class: gui_core.bmx).
